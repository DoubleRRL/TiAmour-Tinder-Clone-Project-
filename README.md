Easy Install

If you follow these directions, you will have a working and simple development environment that makes it easy to play around with this project.

Some of you have a development environment you’re comfortable with. If you can run this project without the install directions then please do. Not all of these steps may be right for you.

—————————————

Setting Up Your Environment

Download Visual Studio Code
https://code.visualstudio.com/download

Why?: “VSCode” has a simple interface, and an easy way to search for helpful 		extensions inside of VSCode.

Make a folder named “Projects” on your desktop
Click File > Open in VSCode

Open the “Projects” folder. You should have a blank project.

And now, we’re going to install Expo, a React Native framework

In VSCode menu bar, click Terminal > New Terminal.

Type “npm install -g expo-cli”

Getting Your Simulator

Download Xcode

https://itunes.apple.com/app/xcode/id497799835

Why?: We need Xcode because it is the easiest way to get you an iOS Simulator on your computer screen. It’s important to have a simulator locally because instant feedback when developing is exciting, motivating and critical.

After Xcode is installed, click on Components in the menu bar and download at least one device simulator. I use the iPhone X simulator and recommend it.

Launching The Project


If you haven’t already, download the zip file of this project and unzip it

Place the unzipped contents that you’ve downloaded into the “Projects” folder that you created on your desktop

Run “npm install” to create the required node_modules folder in your “Projects” directory

After everything is complete, run “expo start” in the Terminal

Your default browser should have launched and connected to the expo client interface. This shows you logs to help diagnose bugs, assess changes and more.

Click on “Run iOS Simulator” towards the left side of the screen

Expo will open the Xcode Simulator you downloaded earlier and run the project for you to interact with.
